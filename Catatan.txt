this is an ISP website with 2 divided api server and databases with a native php programming using laravel, mysql, bootstrap

you can migrate directly each project to the database from the terminal
but just in case I already put an sql database file to be imported if there is a problem with the migration
which is in the website directory

run the project on these port

rest-api-admin --> Port 6969
rest-api-sales --> Port 7676
